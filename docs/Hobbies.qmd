# My Hobbies

## Muay Thai

Muay Thai, often referred to as "The Art of Eight Limbs", is not just a sport for me but a crucial part of my lifestyle. It incorporates punches, kicks, elbows, and knee strikes, making it a very efficient martial art.

### Training in Thailand

Last year, I had the incredible opportunity to travel to Thailand, the birthplace of Muay Thai, for an intensive training session. I spent a month in a training camp in Krabi, immersing myself in the daily life of a Muay Thai fighter.

The experience was transformative, allowing me to not only improve my techniques but also gain a deeper understanding of the Thai culture and its people.

## Travel

Traveling enriches my life in many ways, from experiencing new cultures to meeting people from diverse backgrounds. Training in Thailand was one of the many journeys that have impacted my life significantly.

### Discovering New Places

Apart from training, I explored local markets, temples, and the vibrant street life in Krabi. Each place I visited told a story of its own, brimming with history, flavor, and color.

## Why I Love What I Do

Engaging in Muay Thai and traveling are not just hobbies; they are part of who I am. They teach me discipline, respect, and the joy of discovery, which I apply in every aspect of my life.
